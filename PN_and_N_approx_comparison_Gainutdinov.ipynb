    "The question is, what figures are our orbits? Are they precessing ellipses or, maybe, another elliptic-looking figures?\n",
    "There is a <a href=\"http://www.ihes.fr/~damour/Conferences/DamourDeruelleAIHP85.pdf\">paper on Post-Newtonian 2-body problem by T. Damour and N. Deruelle</a>, that says that the trajectory of body in Post-Newtonian 2-body problem is actually a *conchoid of precessing ellipse*, where precession has constant rate.\n",
    "In our case the central body is massive, while probe body is massless. If we apply this limitation to formulas from the paper above, we can obtain that conchoidal parameter is equal to zero, so  our orbits are not *conchoids*, they are just *precessing ellipses*. If we compensate the precession in polar coordinates, our orbits will become ellipses. That's how I measured eccentricities of Post-Newtonian orbits. I approximated them with ellipses in \"coprecessing\" polar coordinates.\n",
    "Also, the theory predicts that precession has constant rate. That's what we have seen on our plots: The pericenter argument has linear growth."
